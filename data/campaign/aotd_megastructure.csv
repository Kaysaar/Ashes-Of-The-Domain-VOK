It is capable of extracting energy on an astronomical scale directly from the linked star. Losing control of an active coronal hypershunt without following proper shut-down procedures can prove disastrous.",

Designed to bolster a world’s defense and industrial strength, it stands as a critical asset, with robust defensive systems that safeguard both the facility and surrounding regions. Originally built to meet the intense demands of the Domain, its unmatched production capabilities allow for the rapid assembly of powerful fleets, providing a strategic advantage to any faction in control.",

Fragile and far from ideal, it lacks the scale, efficiency, and elegance of its predecessor, limited by reduced range, capacity, and reliability. Yet in a sector long severed from the grandeur of the original gates, it serves its purpose well enough—bridging scattered systems and offering a vital lifeline. Though it pales in comparison to the achievements of the old Domain, the Bifrost Network provides a faint glimpse of humanity’s lost master",ignore_timeline

However, improper use of its lasers or neglection of safety protocols could lead to catastrophic planetary damage.",
