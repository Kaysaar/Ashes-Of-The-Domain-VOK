uaf_restoration_of_novaeria,The Mother of All Carriers,"Novaeria, the brand-new deep space exploration dreadnought, originally built by the United Aurora Federation. With the Solvernia relegated to home defense, the Federation had to design a new ship to act as their vanguard for exploring uncharted space. With state of the art hangar bays and docking facilities, highly trained maintenance teams, and the most advanced sensor array the Federation could develop, such a massive construction project would normally take decades to become a reality. However, looking over the blueprints, your engineers believe that with the aid of your reclaimed Domain technology, they could complete it within just a few cycles, provided they had the necessary resources and industrial facilities...",TRUE,FALSE,$uaf_aqq_nova,5,Core construction;Engine construction;Fitting Weapons ;Hangar construction;System adjustments,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,10000000,,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:200;ships:400,advanced_components:240;ships:400;ships:400;ships:400",Building progress of %s,Novaeria,uaf_supercap_nvi_core,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
uaf_restoration_of_solvernia,Rebirth of Solvernia,"Solvernia, the once-proud vanguard of the November fleet, the defender of the Aoi system, and a symbol of Auroran might, was, at last, defeated. Her massive powerful railguns that could tear entire ships apart in a single salvo, now brought to silence. Her armor, for all its resilience, breached all the same, scattered across unnamed volumes as debris. Your engineers look over her recovered blueprints. 'She must have taken decades to design and build', a young apprentice remarks. Still, they believe that they can do it a lot faster - just a few cycles with your reclaimed Domain of Man technology. As long as they have the resources and industrial facilities they need...",TRUE,FALSE,$uaf_defeated_slvv,6,Core reconstruction;Engine repair;Phanex System Revitalization;System adjustments;Missile system;Hangars;,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5;test6,15000000,,100;25;25;25;100;200,"ships:500;ships:200,advanced_components:240;ships:600;ships:200;ships:400;ships:500",Current state of renovation of %s,Solvernia,uaf_supercap_slv_core,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
uaf_cherry_construction,Question of Space,"Cherry Vanguard, the oldest supercapital-size vessel of the United Aurora Federation. The ship that once brought supplies for the entire expeditionary fleet into the Persean sector, now sits abandoned. Years of neglect since New Aurora was settled have left this ship in poor shape. Stripped of many vital parts by the Federation over the years, she is but a husk of her former self. But her heart - her Macro Melody Drive - remains. Reviewing the Federation historical records and scans of the vessel, your engineers remark that despite all that, she could definitely fly again. It will take some doing, but with your reclaimed Domain technology, and with a big pile of resources, this ship could take to the skies again...",TRUE,FALSE,$uaf_aqq_cherry,5,Melody Core;Massive cargo holds;Engine construction;PD integration;System adjustments,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,12000000,,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:200;ships:500,advanced_components:240;ships:400;ships:700;ships:300",Building progress of %s,Cherry Vanguard,uaf_cherry_core,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
pmm_champion_mk2,New Generation of Champions,"Every once in a while, one of your subordinates approaches you with a proposal for a very unhinged project. Most are too unrealistic to be practical, but this one has caught your eye, for some reason. You're not exactly sure who proposed you the idea of modifying a Champion-class heavy cruiser to incorporate a Domain-era Plasma Dynamo as its power core, but with the promise of a more powerful Champion-class ship, with a more efficient energy and flux grids, and an integrated arc emitter, your engineers agreed to try. 'The math works out well enough', one engineer remarks. Now all they need to build it is a working Dynamo and a pile of other stuff...",TRUE,TRUE,$pmm_aqq_champ,5,Ship procurement;Engine rework;Dynamo preparation;Hull preparation;Emitter installation,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,150000,plasma_dynamo:1,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:50;ships:120,advanced_components:60;advanced_components:100;ships:100,advanced_components:50;ships:50",Building progress of %s,Champion Mk2,pmm_champion2,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
acs_junkhubship_build,To Brave the Abyss,"Based on some schematics and documents from the late Admiral Methuselah, the Djoeng-class Voidfaring Hubship was originally commissioned by earth Domain Explorarium Command, to serve as an exploration command hub in the furthest reaches of the cosmos, to be able to survive in the most isolated and barren parts of the galaxy, and, should a great cataclysm befall the rest of human civilization, remain the final bastion of humankind, to rebuild no matter what. And though it comes from a different era of human history, and will require an immense amount of resources and Domain-era relics to build, should it ever be finished - it will be the perfect vessel for exploring the most hostile corner of the Persean sector - the Abyss. A ship to not just survive, but thrive in it. With a massive independent shield module, designed to protect this ship without accidentally destroying it should it ever overload, and a dedicated onboard autoforge designed to not just service and maintain entire fleets in deep space, but produce entirely new vessels and automated defense drones from scratch, to ensure the survival of the main vessel in engagement, and to ensure that even if left alone, this ship will never be without an escort. It will be a massive undertaking and will have a lot of technical challenges to solve, but your engineers believe that they could just about make it work...",TRUE,FALSE,$acs_aqq_junkhubship,6,Frame Construction; Core module; Independent Shield Module; Left Barge Module; Right Barge Module; Fleet Gantry and Drone Constructor,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5;test6,12000000,"pristine_nanoforge:1,drone_replicator:1,plasma_dynamo:1",100;25;100;25;100;200,"ships:100;ships:300;ships:100,advanced_components:150;ships:200;ships:150,hand_weapons:200;ships:200,hand_weapons:150,advanced_components:170",Construction progress of %s,Voidfaring Hubship,acs_junkhubship_module,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
ix_radiant_conversion,Stolen Radiance,"The relics left behind in the wake of the First AI War wrecked havoc upon the IXth Domain Battlegroup during their arrival in the Persean Sector, and ensured that the survivors, among other things, have both great fear, and great respect for the automated Radiant-class battleships. Once open war between them and the sector became inevitable, IXth Battlegroup Fleet Command ordered their ships to go out and hunt for Radiants, taking in their disabled hulls back to their fleetyards for inspection and retrofit. These ships, once almost inaccessible to humans due to their automated construction, were stripped of all their intelligent machinery, gutted and turned into ships fit for humans to command. With standard, if awkward-shaped living quarters, bridge and life support systems, overtuned shields, recalibrated for human safety, and a built-in spinal Soliton Burst Emitter, the IXth Battlegroup Radiants became a mainstay of their fleets. Now, your engineers examine recovered Battlegroup blueprints. How they got there is unimportant, but they remark that the modifications made are very clever indeed, and, should we wish to, we could definitely build one too, provided we give the engineers the resources and industrial capacity they need...",TRUE,TRUE,$ix_aqq_radiant,4,Bridge Conversion; Life Support Systems; Shield Modulation; Emitter Installation,test1;test2;test3;test4;,750000,radiant:1,50;25;25;50,ships:100;ships:50;ships:50;advanced_components:50,Conversion progress of %s,Radiant (IX),radiant_ix,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
aotd_guardian,Guardian's Awakening,"The corrupted horror of a drone, usually spoken about by spacers only in hushed tones, the Guardian-class, is a terrifying sight to behold. A relic of the Domain Explorarium, twisted beyond recognition. Ships like this prowl the fringes, defending ancient arks and sleepers for reasons never told. 'To face one is to stare down the face of Moloch...' - say the captains of the Luddic faith - '...and to try and understand is to resign all that is to be a human'. Your engineers do not share their superstition. With ample scans acquired by your fleet, and with some creative system redesigns, they believe that they could build one of these terrifying beasts, chained and shackled to human goals, and your command, it will not feature an automated control system, but rather conventional crew quarters and a bridge. Upgrading outdated systems, and adapting twisted ones, your engineers say that such a ship will take quite a lot of resources to build, but once finished, it could be the key to dominate any battlefield...",TRUE,TRUE,$aotd_aqq_guardian,3,Bridge Construction; Engine Construction;System Calibration,test1;test2;test3;,1500000,alpha_core:1,50;25;45,"ships:150;ships:100;advanced_components:30,hand_weapons:200",Building progress of %s,Guardian,guardian,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
