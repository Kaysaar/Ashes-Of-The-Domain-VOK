uaf_supercap_slv_project,Rebirth of Solvernia,"Solvernia, the once-proud vanguard of the November fleet, and a symbol of Auroran might and engineering. She stood as a stalwart defender of the United Aurora Federation, putting up fearsome resistance, her all-powerful railguns tearing ships in two, her armor withstanding an unholy amount of punishment. And yet she was brought low all the same. This massive wreck is all that remains. However, your engineers are confident in the research you have done into the Domain of Man. They believe that with your knowledge, the Solvernia can be returned to her rightful glory. They only require the material and enormous industrial capabilities...…","uaf_slv_stage1:20,uaf_slv_stage2:20,uaf_slv_stage3:20,uaf_slv_stage4:20,uaf_slv_stage5:20",uaf_supercap_slv_core:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",uaf_supercap_slv_core:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.SolviSpecialProject,uaf,,,,
aotd_compound_project,Exotic-Mass Repolarisation,"Following a breakthrough in antimatter fuel synthesis, our scientists have uncovered a novel method to manipulate exotic particle states within fuel matrices. This process, dubbed Exotic-Mass Repolarisation, realigns subatomic mass polarities to significantly enhance the energy yield of antimatter reactions. By refining fuel at the quantum level, this advancement promises increased propulsion efficiency and extended operational ranges for high-energy vessels—pushing the boundaries of power generation and deep-space travel.","compound_stage1:20,compound_stage2:20,compound_stage3:20",compound:COMMODITY:300,"ability,physics",compound:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.CompoundSpecialProject,aotd_vok,,,,
aotd_nanoforge_restoration,Nanoforge Corruption Analysis,"Recent advancements in adaptive AI algorithms have sparked a bold new theory among our researchers: corrupted nanoforges—long considered unstable and hazardous—may not be beyond recovery. By interfacing select AI cores with compromised fabrication matrices, it may be possible to isolate, diagnose, and even reverse systemic degradation. This project explores the potential to restore these industrial titans to optimal function, reclaiming lost manufacturing potential and redefining what we consider ""beyond salvage.""",aotd_nanoforge_restoration_stage_1:20,corrupted_nanoforge:ITEM:300,"item,computers,repeatable",corrupted_nanoforge:ITEM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.NanoforgeAnalysisProject,aotd_vok,,,,

However, while the hardware is now within reach, the software remains elusive. Our current understanding of AI behavior lacks the foundational algorithmic structures required to produce functioning cores. Scientists propose that through extensive analysis and reverse-engineering of existing AI cores, we may eventually develop the capability to imprint rudimentary intelligences—potentially replicating Beta-level cores under controlled conditions.","aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_1:20,aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_2:20,aotd_ai_core_basic_algorythms_stage_3:20",beta_core:COMMODITY:300,"ability,computers",ai_core_production:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.BasicAIAlgorithmsProject,aotd_vok,,,,
pmm_champion_mk2,New Generation of Champion,"This project, based on rare and costly underworld schematics, involves the extensive modification of a Champion-class heavy cruiser to incorporate a Domain-era Plasma Dynamo. The upgrade focuses on overhauling the ship's energy systems, particularly the ""Crowning"" energy subsystems situated beneath a heavy energy battery. This configuration enables the efficient redirection of flux into the energy grid and the integration of an arc emitter.

As such the project involve great amount of resource and specialized domain era relic as neccessary component to construct a vessel that can traverse the abyss without the help of gates system and able to not only survive but also thrive in every possible situation.

ix_radiant_conversion,Stolen Radiance,"The leftover detritus of the First AI War wrecked havoc upon the 9th Domain Battlegroup during its arrival in the Persean Sector, and cemented among the survivors a healthy respect for the battleship sized Radiant-class automatons. Once open war with the rest of the Sector became inevitable, Fleet Command made capturing and refitting Radiant hulls for the Fleet's own use a top priority. The AI core housing and much of the internal circuitry is systematically removed and replaced with a conventional bridge, living quarters, and life support systems. The shields are then re-calibrated for crew safety. Last but not least, a built-in Soliton Burst Emitter is integrated into the central weapon mount. The result is a converted Radiant that can be operated by a human crew, as one of the most powerful battleships in the Sector.","ix_radiant_conversion_stage_1:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_2:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_3:20,ix_radiant_conversion_stage_4:20",radiant_ix:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering,repeatable",radiant_ix:SHIP:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.IXRadiantConversionProject,EmergentThreats_IX_Revival,,,,

ass_arkoship,Arkoship Construction,"Intended to tour frontier systems the class was built capable of housing many thousands and self sustaining human habitation for prolonged periods. The Archliner, was an arcology ship, one of largest projects by Mbaye-Gogol and a rare sight even pre-Collapse as its immense size prevents the use of the Gate system and it has to be constructed on site in special temporary docks.

As such only a dozen or so were ever constructed in the Persean, all seen as exorbitant flights of hubris they nonetheless proved valuable humanitarian assets in the early Collapse chaos and even more valuable improvised military assets in the AI Wars and the ensuing troubles. Though of the number present before the Collapse many have since fallen victim of disrepair or gunfire. Most recent and notable have been the three sisters which responded to Daud's call and fell to defend Chicomoztoc.","ass_arkoship_stage1:20,ass_arkoship_stage2:20,ass_arkoship_stage3:20,ass_arkoship_stage4:20,ass_arkoship_stage5:20",ass_arkship:SHIP:500,"ship,ship_engineering",ass_arkship:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.ASSArkoshipProject,arthrships,,,,

aotd_shroud_better_contaiment,Perfected Containment Procedures,"Shrouded Substrate, as our scientists call it, has been identified as unstable raw energy originating from a different dimension. It is theorized that within the Abyss, the boundary between dimensions is extremely thin, resulting in a phenomenon known as Abyssal Light. From what we have gathered, the creatures—now referred to as Shroud Dwellers—lure anything that lingers in the darkness by providing the only source of light capable of penetrating this... unusual gloom.

With more samples of Substrate, we will be able to develop improved containment methods, allowing for a higher extraction yield from the Dwellers",aotd_better_contaiment_1:20,shrouded_substrate:ITEM:250,"item,shroud,dangerous",aotd_shrouded_substrate:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.shroud.ShroudContainmentImprovement,aotd_vok,,,,
aotd_shroud_beacon,Dweller Lure Protocols,"A breakthrough has occurred from the scientist in Black Site. They're calling it Shrouded Substrate for now, which has been identified as exceptionally unstable but potent energy that is theorized to only occur naturally deep in the heart of the Abyss. Such anomalies are theorized to originate from locations where the boundaries to reality are thinnest and records of this so called ""Abyssal Light"" are prevalent. Further research will be required with fresh samples if we are to learn what manner of creatures...these Shroud Dwellers...are and if they are worth pursuing. To this end, modifications to the sensor array have been made to make detecting such anomalies easier though the side effect is that it is more of becoming a larger and more appetising lure.","aotd_shroud_beacon_1:20,aotd_shroud_beacon_2:20",shrouded_thunderhead:ITEM:250,"item,shroud,dangerous",aotd_shrouded_substrate:CUSTOM:1,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.scripts.specialprojects.projects.shroud.ShroudBeacon,aotd_vok,,,,
