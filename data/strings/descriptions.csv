parked_cryosleeper,CUSTOM,"This monumental vessel, now a beacon of our kinder past. Domain Exploraria commissioned these to deliver millions of people safely to distant reaches of space, autonomous guardians tending their cryosleep. Once claimed outcasts, then praised explorers, now a hope for the Persean Sector. Found drifting and carried to stable orbit to remind us of the wonders of the Domain",,,
electronics,RESOURCE,Essential in cutting edge equipment production and bespoke shipbuilding.,,,
water,RESOURCE,"One of the first problems humanity has solved, now taken for granted and dismissed by planet dwellers. Spacers in their orbitals, however, could sing poems about recirculation cycles and what subtle undertones they bring, if anybody cared. 
Low margin, abundant, incompressible and a bitch to ship, it is however used as a base for high performance reagents, solvents et cetera. Stations and hell worlds also need it imported to survive.",,,
biotics,RESOURCE,"The term 'biotic' is used to describe materials derived from living organisms, but in layman terms, it is considered somewhat fancy and is reserved for high purity extracts and high performance materials obtained by processing something of natural origin. Biomass-based compounds are employed in industrial chemistry, medicine, and other fields. Natural materials, decidedly less advanced, are used in construction and light manufacturing as they were for millennia.",,,
recitificates,RESOURCE,"Natural resources, be it various biochemicals, carbohydrates, hydrocarbon, some metals and polymers have been efficiently extracted from substrates since the dawn of civilisation. While some industrial processes to economically refine said resources from organics are comparatively modern developments, the humble reflux reactor and regenerating molecular sieve to render and dry organic spirits we owe to Old Earth itself.",,,
purified_ore,RESOURCE,"Extremely pure ore samples, processed via lengthy beneficiation process and ready to be processed into extreme duty alloys.",,,
purified_rare_ore,RESOURCE,"High purity rare and heavy elements, ran through separation laps to remove low-performance and less viable isotopes. ",,,
polymer,RESOURCE,"Advanced polymers made with highly refined organic matter and no less than 11 proprietary compounds and additives, tailored to specific industrial application by expert material engineers.",,,
compound,RESOURCE,"Assortment of bespoke complex molecules ready to be used and used in extreme-performance mission-specific substances, additives and reagents.",,,
refined_metal,RESOURCE,"Extreme duty, precisely controlled grain structure alloy parts, billets and composite prefabs. Made to extremely demanding specifications, these articles command high price and come with guarantees and passports, ready for use in super-spec warship and battleship construction. ",,,
purified_rare_metal,RESOURCE,"Unmatched (and undisclosed) performance components, ranging from zero stress wafers and lattices to what looks like fully autonomous diffused systems and proprietary-looking parts with application unknown. Traced use in maintenance of domain-era equipment, avant-garde electronics, various sensors and apparata for envelope-pushing scientific research.",,,
research_databank,RESOURCE,"Not empty and thus valuable data units, bearing late Domain or early Sector markings. The data inside is usually encrypted with algorithms either too resistant or otherwise too intensive to crack and thus out of favor in contemporary Sector, requiring both a set-up and a know-how. The end user, however industrious or desperate to crack the code, will then have to figure out what to do with all the centuries old bookkeeping records on their hands.",,,
bifrost_gate,CUSTOM,"An orbital kilo-structure built in replication of the former Domain’s gate network. Requiring pre-collapse expertise and materials to maintain, as well as the janus device to activate, the Bifrost Gate is the closest replica to the now dormant gate-network in the sector. Due to the experimental nature of the gate, and the principles involved, apon the action of the gate towards its target’s destination, it requires 30 days before sufficient stability is reached to allow operation again.",,,
