parked_cryosleeper,CUSTOM,"This monumental vessel, now a beacon of our kinder past. Domain Exploraria commissioned these to deliver millions of people safely to distant reaches of space, autonomous guardians tending their cryosleep. Once claimed outcasts, then praised explorers, now a hope for the Persean Sector. Found drifting and carried to stable orbit to remind us of the wonders of the Domain",,,
advanced_components,RESOURCE,Essential in cutting edge equipment production and bespoke shipbuilding.,,,
water,RESOURCE,"One of the first problems humanity has solved, now taken for granted and dismissed by planet dwellers. Spacers in their orbitals, however, could sing poems about recirculation cycles and what subtle undertones they bring, if anybody cared. 
Low margin, abundant, incompressible and a bitch to ship, it is however used as a base for high performance reagents, solvents et cetera. Stations and hell worlds also need it imported to survive.",,,
biotics,RESOURCE,"The term 'biotic' is used to describe materials derived from living organisms, but in layman terms, it is considered somewhat fancy and is reserved for high purity extracts and high performance materials obtained by processing something of natural origin. Biomass-based compounds are employed in industrial chemistry, medicine, and other fields. Natural materials, decidedly less advanced, are used in construction and light manufacturing as they were for millennia.",,,
recitificates,RESOURCE,"Natural resources, be it various biochemicals, carbohydrates, hydrocarbon, some metals and polymers have been efficiently extracted from substrates since the dawn of civilisation. While some industrial processes to economically refine said resources from organics are comparatively modern developments, the humble reflux reactor and regenerating molecular sieve to render and dry organic spirits we owe to Old Earth itself.",,,
purified_ore,RESOURCE,"Extremely pure ore samples, processed via lengthy beneficiation process and ready to be processed into extreme duty alloys.",,,
purified_rare_ore,RESOURCE,"High purity rare and heavy elements, ran through separation laps to remove low-performance and less viable isotopes. ",,,
polymer,RESOURCE,"Advanced polymers made with highly refined organic matter and no less than 11 proprietary compounds and additives, tailored to specific industrial application by expert material engineers.",,,
compound,RESOURCE,Product of the Exotic-Mass Repolarisation project. This advanced material boosts antimatter fuel efficiency tenfold.,,,
refined_metal,RESOURCE,"Extreme duty, precisely controlled grain structure alloy parts, billets and composite prefabs. Made to extremely demanding specifications, these articles command high price and come with guarantees and passports, ready for use in super-spec warship and battleship construction. ",,,
purified_rare_metal,RESOURCE,"Highly concentrated, further-processed heavy elements — refined actinides and rarer exotics pushed beyond standard grades using centrifuge cascades and salvaged pre-Collapse datasets. The result is material with markedly higher energy density and reactivity than base stocks, indispensable for advanced reactors, prototype weaponry, and frontier research; it is difficult to stabilize, hazardous to handle, and traded under strict, often clandestine, controls.",,,
research_databank,RESOURCE,"Not empty and thus valuable data units, bearing late Domain or early Sector markings. The data inside is usually encrypted with algorithms either too resistant or otherwise too intensive to crack and thus out of favor in contemporary Sector, requiring both a set-up and a know-how. The end user, however industrious or desperate to crack the code, will then have to figure out what to do with all the centuries old bookkeeping records on their hands.",,,
bifrost_gate,CUSTOM,"An orbital kilo-structure built in replication of the former Domain’s gate network. Requiring pre-collapse expertise and materials to maintain, as well as the janus device to activate, the Bifrost Gate is the closest replica to the now dormant gate-network in the sector. Due to the experimental nature of the gate, and the principles involved, apon the action of the gate towards its target’s destination, it requires 30 days before sufficient stability is reached to allow operation again.",,,
domain_heavy_machinery,RESOURCE,"High-precision industrial tools from the pre-collapse era, engineered for crafting advanced systems and materials. These tools accept manual operation, various design templates, or can integrate with network controls. Built to exacting standards, they enable the construction of complex technologies with unmatched efficiency, durability, and accuracy.",,,
aotd_hypershunt_reciver,CUSTOM,"This Domain-era marvel utilizes a miniaturized wormhole interface to draw immense power directly from a nearby coronal hypershunt, offering a colony nearly limitless energy. The process begins by consuming large quantities of transplutonics to establish and stabilize the wormhole. Once operational, the power draw is self-sustaining.",,,
pluto_station,CUSTOM,"This class of mining station epitomized the industrial ingenuity of the Domain, using its massive mining array to efficiently extract resources from the neighboring planet and refine them on-site, providing Domain-grade materials on a scale unfathomably superior to planetary operations. However, improper use of its lasers or neglection of safety protocols could lead to catastrophic planetary damage.",,,
wwlb_cerulean_vapors,RESOURCE,"Derived from harvested hyperspace clouds, this highly addictive substance is most well known for its wild hallucinatory nature, capable of completely shutting down external cognition in favor of an internal rollercoaster of wild colors, concepts, and the recurring dream of floating through a fiery nebula. What is not as well known are the effects of prolonged use - including but not limited to hair loss, lung cancer, and various schizoeffective disorders.

Typically inhaled through aerosolized canisters, the familiar odor of the recently invented vapors are described as a mix between ammonia and hesperus grain, with accents of mint and an overwhelming afterscent of chemicals. This distinctive scent has led to the rather ease of enforcement by local MuniSecs - and in fact, may have made drugbusts more effective overall.",,,
aotd_shadowlance,WEAPON,"A product of the clandestine ""Binding Forces of Entropy"" Project. This Tenebrium-based weapon converts flux into a piercing energy beam, by using Tenebrium Cells as medium, by which flux is converted.",,,
gungnir_railgun,WEAPON,"Reality shudders with each pulse of its complex subsystems as pionic ultracapacitors and neutronium transistors brutally bend untainted kinetic energy to its bidding. With such complexities, the weapon is likely to be the only one in existence, poising as a reminder of the heights from which the Domain fell from.",,,
